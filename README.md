## LaunchPad1

### Assignment Description

This assignment was to code the serial monitor to count down from 10 to 0, with one second in between. It prints "Liftoff!" after landing.

### Evidence 

![Video](images/Astronaut_pt1.mp4) 

### Wiring

N.A.

### Code
[Part 1 code](https://github.com/afriedm49/Engineering4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Astronaut1.py)

### Reflection

It was challenging at first to figure out the for loop, but easy once I got it. It important to make sure that your step is negative if you are trying to count down, or else you will need to do print(10-x) for each value of x from 0 to 10.

## LaunchPad2

### Assignment Description

This assignment was to add on to part 1 by plugging in an external red LED which blinks as time goes down, and a green LED which stays on during liftoff.

### Evidence

### Wiring

### Code
[Part 2 code](https://github.com/afriedm49/Engineering4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Astronaut2.py)

### Reflection

Make sure you are using OUTPUT on your LED direction, and get your led to turn on and off within the for loop, so it continually repeats.

## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
